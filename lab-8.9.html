		<p>Laissez-faire is an economic theory from the 18th century that opposed any government intervention in business affairs. The driving principle behind laissez-faire, a French term that translates to "leave alone" (literally, "let you do"), is that the less the government is involved in</p>
		<p> the economy, the better off business will be, and by extension, society as a whole. Laissez-faire economics is a key part of free-market capitalism.</p>
